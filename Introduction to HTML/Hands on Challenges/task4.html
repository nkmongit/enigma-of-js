        <strong>Book Description: </strong><u>Go</u> is rapidly becoming the
        preferred language for building web services. While there are plenty of
        tutorials available that teach <u>Go's</u> syntax to developers with
        experience in other programming languages, tutorials aren't enough. They
        don't teach <u>Go's</u> idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns
        that don't make sense in a <u>Go</u> context. This practical guide
        provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic
        <u>Go's</u>.
