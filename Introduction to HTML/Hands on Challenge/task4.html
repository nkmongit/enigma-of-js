        <strong>Book Description: </strong>Go is rapidly becoming the preferred
        language for building web services. While there are plenty of tutorials
        available that teach Go's syntax to developers with experience in other
        programming languages, tutorials aren't enough. They don't teach Go's
        idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don't make sense
        in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background
        you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.
